# Molecular-Solubility-with-Torch-Geometric
This code trains a graph convolutional network in Torch Geometric to predict the solubility of molecules

For an overview of the code, see the [Medium article](https://sullyfchen.medium.com/predicting-drug-solubility-with-deep-learning-b5e48ff61206) I wrote!
